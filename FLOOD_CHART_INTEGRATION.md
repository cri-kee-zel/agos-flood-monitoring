# ðŸŽ¯ FLOOD LEVEL REFERENCE CHART INTEGRATION

## âœ… CSS Updates Complete!

The water level container has been updated to use your flood level reference chart as a background image.

## ðŸ“¥ NEXT STEP: Add the Image File

Please save the flood level reference chart image as:

```
c:\Users\effie\Desktop\agos\module_1\assets\flood-level-reference.png
c:\Users\effie\Desktop\agos\public\module_1\assets\flood-level-reference.png
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Changes Made:

1. **Background Image**: Added flood level reference chart as background
2. **Semi-transparent Water**: Water fill is now 30-70% transparent so chart shows through
3. **Subtle Scale Marks**: Made measurement scale less prominent to avoid competing with background
4. **Perfect Alignment**: Background sized to fit container properly

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details:

- Image path: `/module_1/assets/flood-level-reference.png`
- Background sizing: `contain` (maintains aspect ratio)
- Position: `center` (centered in container)
- Water transparency: 30-70% opacity gradient
- Scale marks: Subtle with dark background for readability

## ðŸš€ Result:

Once you add the image file, the water level visualization will show:

- Your flood level reference chart in the background
- Semi-transparent blue water that rises/falls over the chart
- Clear visual correlation between actual water level and flood danger zones
- Professional appearance with human/vehicle reference scales

Simply save the image in both locations and refresh your browser! ðŸŽ‰
